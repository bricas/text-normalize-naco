NAME
    Text::Normalize::NACO - Normalize text based on the NACO rules

SYNOPSIS
        # exported method
        use Text::Normalize::NACO qw( naco_normalize );
    
        $normalized = naco_normalize( $original );
    
        # as an object
        $naco       = Text::Normalize::NACO->new;
        $normalized = $naco->normalize( $original );

        # normalize to lowercase
        $naco->case( 'lower' );
        $normalized = $naco->normalize( $original );

DESCRIPTION
    In general, normalization is defined as:

        To make (a text or language) regular and consistent, especially with respect to spelling or style.

    It is commonly used for comparative purposes. These particular
    normalization rules have been set out by the Name Authority Cooperative.
    The rules are described in detail at:
    http://www.loc.gov/catdir/pcc/naco/normrule.html

INSTALLATION
            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install

METHODS
  new( %options )
    Creates a new Text::Normalize::NACO object. You explicitly request
    strings to be normalized in upper or lower-case by setting the "case"
    option (defaults to "upper").

        my $naco = Text::Normalize::NACO->new( case => 'lower' );

  case( $case )
    Accessor/Mutator for the case in which the string should be returned.

        # lower-case
        $naco->case( 'lower' );

        # upper-case
        $naco->case( 'upper' );

  naco_normalize( $text, { %options } )
    Exported version of "normalize". You can specify any extra options by
    passing a hashref after the string to be normalized.

        my $normalized = naco_normalize( $original, { case => 'lower' } );

  normalize( $text )
    Normalizes $text and returns the new string.

        my $normalized = $naco->normalize( $original );
